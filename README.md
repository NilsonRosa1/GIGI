# GIGI - Logic Assistant Bot

## Introduction
Our project was developed with the aim of helping people who have difficulty learning logic.

As students of the Data Science course at FATEC Ourinhos, we realized that some of our colleagues were having difficulties in the subject and did not have enough time available to study, notebook and pencil in hand.
So the solution would have to be in the palm of your hand! Literally! The GIGI Logic assistant that runs in every smartphone.
